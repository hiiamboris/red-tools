	Usage: {
To use basic authenticationmust set GITHUB/USER and GITHUB/PASS to your username
and password. However basic authentication isgoing to be removed from GitHub API
during 2020, so you should use Github personal token instead. See: https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line
how to get one and set it to GITHUB/TOKEN. If token is present, API will
automatically use it.
